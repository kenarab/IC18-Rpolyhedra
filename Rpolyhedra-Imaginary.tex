\subsection{Speaker information for the conference program}

%Please add a short description of yourself for our conference program (max. 3 sentences). We appreciate to receive a low-resolution photo of you for the conference website. If you agree, please upload your photo as a separate file in the submission form.


Geometric lab is a project created by Alejandro Baranek and Leonardo Belen researching productivity techinques to close the gap bringing polyhedra to the physical world, for science, design, art and educational proposes.


Rpolyhedra is an R package published in CRAN and under review in RopenSci which compiles and distribute +800 polyhedra definitions from freely availables sources on the internet.

As part of a project aimed to simplify the access to an open design framework based on polyhedra and tesselations, we needed to retrieve internet information about polyhedra definitions. The work involved the transformation of the data in each source format to a common representation (which can lead to a standard proposal for data exchange) which constitutes a polyhedra database.  

With that in mind, we created a standards based R package, which is available on the CRAN Repository as "Rpolyhedra" and enables users to handle and explore +800 polyhedra definitions with minimum effort. The publication iniciative includes a web explorer \cite{RPOLY_EXPLORER} to lower the burden for non-technical users.


The IC18 talk will focus on the unlocking possibilites derived from the availability of polyhedra constructive methods based on 3D printing and other DIY-technologies for the whole Rpolyhedra database. The participants of the talk will be able to construct from the models available for their exhibits, providing educational resources as well. And we hope, to imagine, design and share different constructive methods to improve the experience about polyhedra out of the screen and the notebook, into the world, playing with the hands.

Polyhedra world is quite rich and we found that when the word polyhedron is mentioned, usually refers to no more than 10 objects (regular solids+ some more polyhedra). With Rpolyhedra, users will be able to research on whole families of polyhedra without the need to master the technical details.

The talk will cover some basic notions about polyhedra and classifications. But will focus on the process of building the database, more a data science project than a mathematical research. Although we found out that some of the most interesting and open source alternatives were not maintained, we migrated, started a curation process and make publicly available the contents to allow new approaches and developments.

The sources currently available are Netlib's Polyhedra\cite{NETLIB}, by Andrew Hume and Visual Polyhedra\cite{DMCCOOEY} by David McCooey. Other databases where found but didn't provide new information (\cite{NAT_ALISON}, \cite{GEORGE_HART}, \cite{WOLFRAM_ALPHA_TETRA},\cite{WIKIPEDIA_TETRA}). One special case is polymake\cite{POLYMAKE}, a language for research in polyhedral geometry, a deep technical research tool which includes database capabilities. 


Along with the creation of the library, the talk will continue with our experiences with existing constructive methods and taking its lessons to the next level showing our experience on Augmented Reality (AR) for interactive polyhedra design.
